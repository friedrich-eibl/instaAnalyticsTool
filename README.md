# InstaAnalyticsTool

InstaAnalyticsTool is a free collection of useful scripts to get stats from any Instagram profile without login or registration. To make this possible it runs without using the Instagram Graph API but rather scraping the data from the site on its own. This project is still in production and the most exciting features like a web interface are yet to come!

## Dependencies
This project is utilizing selenium, plotly and a browser of your choice. Depending on your browser you might have to install the according driver and enable your browser in the metrics.py script. Not every script needs all these tools. Even without them you will be able to use most of the scripts but not the whole project!
